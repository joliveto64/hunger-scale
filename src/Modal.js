      <h1>What is Hunger Scale?</h1>
      <p>
        Hunger scale is not a health nutrition app. Hunger scale looks at
        nutrition information and determines how satisfying/filling a
        particpular food is likely to be.
      </p>
      <h3>Satiety</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          "A state or condition of fullness; the opposite of hunger"
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One aspect of nutrition which is often overlooked is satiety. When
        establishing better eating habits, part of the battle involves choosing
        foods which are not just healthy, but also make you feel full and
        satisfiedâ€”so you to eat less and less often. Foods which are higher in
        fiber, higher in protein, lower in fat, lower in sugar and have a lower
        caloric density are thought to be more satisfying.
      </p>
      <p>
        A rating of 6 or higher indicates higher satisfaction, whereas a rating
        of 4 or less indicates lower satisfaction.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that some foods may indicate a high level of satisfaction,
        but are not be generally considered "healthy". This is correct and
        expected behavior.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Limitations: this app is intended to be used as a general guide. There
        are many factors to include when considering levels of satisfaction,
        some of which are not taken into account in Hunger Scale. Lastly,
        satiety is largely subjective. Some people might find the same food to
        be more or less satisfying than someone else. Because of this, Hunger
        Scale is best used to compare the relative satiety between various
        foods.{" "}
