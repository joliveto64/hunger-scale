# Hunger Scale

An informative app that uses nutritional data to determine relative satiety (fullness) of various foods.

Satiety: a state or condition of fullness; the opposite of hunger.

When it comes to food, some caloric sources (like high fiber and protein) are
known to cause greater satisfaction/fullness, whereas others (like high sugar) are
not. This app provides as easy way to compare different foods to see which ones
are more likely to be satisfying.
